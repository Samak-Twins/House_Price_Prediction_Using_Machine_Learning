# House Price Prediction Using Machine Learning
This project uses supervised machine learning to predict the price of a property based upon its size. The training data set contains the data of around 100 different hypothetical houses, their area and their price.  The user has to enter the area of the house as the input and the program predicts the price of that house using machine learning and displays it as output.
